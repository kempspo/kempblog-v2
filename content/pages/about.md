### About Kemp Po
I got a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Analytics at Ateneo de Manila University. Previously, I also completed a Data Science Bootcamp that allowed me to sharpen some skills like communicating to my insights to non-technical stakeholders and clearly defining a business problem. 

Currently, I work at [First Circle](https://www.firstcircle.ph/), a startup working towards financial inclusion for small and medium enterprises, as a Data Analyst. I am also volunteering for a COVID-19 Philippines LGU Monitoring Platform and helping them develop the different reports and systems to equip our local government units with the necessary information to respond to the pandemic.

I am a data person and problem solver that enjoys developing data products where they are needed. I'm passionate about leveraging data to improve people's lives, not being limited to what I know, but also exploring the different technologies available to me. Some industries that interest me heavily are: finance, health, transportation, energy, and supply chain. Many of these industries can be further improved and expanded through the use of data in optimizing processes and understanding where attention is needed.

### About this website
At some point, I realized that I had thoughts and practices that I wanted to share to the world especially in the budding data community in the Philippines, where many people come from the non-Computer Science side of things. 

This version of the website you are seeing today is the second iteration. Initially, the website was built on Django and deployed using Docker onto a DigitalOcean server. Eventually, making changes to the website became a chore and styling was a pain. This triggered a moved to [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), a static site generator built on Python using the [Flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex).

You can headover to the [repo](https://github.com/kempspo/kempblog-v2) to checkout how the site is built.
